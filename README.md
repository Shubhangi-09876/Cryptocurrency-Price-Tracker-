# Cryptocurrency-Price-Tracker-
Built an end-to-end Crypto ETL pipeline using Python and CoinGecko API to extract live OHLC price data, transformed JSON into structured time-series with Pandas, and loaded to CSV/PostgreSQL for analytics. Implemented error handling, API integration, and automated data processing workflow.
